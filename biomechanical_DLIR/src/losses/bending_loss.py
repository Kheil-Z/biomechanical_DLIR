"""
Loss module for regularizing deformations using bending energy.

Wraps MONAI's BendingEnergyLoss to provide a consistent interface for
both loss computation and metric reporting.

Key Features:
    - `loss(inputs, ddf)`: Computes the bending energy of the displacement field `ddf`.
    - `metric(inputs, ddf)`: Returns the scalar bending energy as a logging-friendly metric.
    - Supports both 2D and 3D deformation fields via MONAIâ€™s BendingEnergyLoss.

Notes:
    - The deformation field `ddf` is assumed to be in the format (B, 2, H, W) or (B, 3, D, H, W).
